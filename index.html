  My name is Addison Murry, I am currently enrolled in Kansas Univeristy. While attending school I also work at Jay Wolfe Toyota
  where I service cars. In hopes to make a career change I am learing web development and its really difficult, but there are great people
  attending school with me so there's always someone around to help. My hopes aftere completing this course is to work in back-end development.
